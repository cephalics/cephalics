Welcome to Cephalics!

This is a collection of Lix levels.
The difficulty levels vary.

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): PLAYING

=== How does one solve level X? anchor:bm_how_solve[]

Once you install this level pack (see <<bm_install,How do I play these levels?>> hereunder),
you will be able to find and watch the developers' replays in-game using the standard _Load Replay_ button.
(Those replays are collected in the directory `replays/`.)

Additional hints and replays will be collected on the Wiki.

To request addition of hints or replays for a particular level,
file a feature request.

// TODO: in the walkthrough list quotes, etc., that might not be recognized (e.g., the title of advent.txt)

=== What are those triangular warning signs?

There's several of these:

image:lixdatadir/images/green-frisbee/warning-hatch.png[width=32]::
On this level, some or all hatches (entrances to the level) are not visible before the level starts.

image:assets/derived/warning-l-r-traffic.svg[width=32]::
Two-way hatch: incoming lixes will not all face the same way.
+
(Typically, incoming lixes will face left and right alternately.)

image:lixdatadir/images/green-frisbee/warning-invisible-traps.png[width=32])::
Beware of quicksand!  Some tiles will kill a lix that steps on them.
+
The level is nevertheless expected to be solvable on the first attempt,
unless image:assets/derived/not-solvable-the-first-time.reconstructed.svg[width=16] is posted as well.

image:lixdatadir/images/green-frisbee/warning-invisible-goals.png[width=32])::
Beware!  Some goals (exits) are invisible.
A lix may exit the level before you planned for it to.
+
The level is nevertheless expected to be solvable on the first attempt,
unless image:assets/derived/not-solvable-the-first-time.reconstructed.svg[width=16] is posted as well.

image:assets/derived/not-solvable-the-first-time.reconstructed.svg[width=32]::
This level uses
link:images/example-notfirsttime-invisibility.png[invisible tiles] and/or
link:images/example-notfirsttime-dice.png[randomness], and therefore
may require multiple attempts to win, even with perfect play.
// "Invisible tiles" doesn't _quite_ capture Magma Enigma, but it's close enough.
// We don't want spoilers in README.
+
_This is rare._ The vast majority of levels in this level pack don't do anything of this sort
and _are_ solvable on the first try.

// ðŸ’¡ Lix tip:
// Press `/` at the level-choosing screen to search for a level by name.

image:lixdatadir/images/green-frisbee/warning-transparent.G.png[width=32])::
Beware!  In this level, link:https://m.xkcd.com/363/[some triangular warning signs are transparent]
(can be neither walked on nor climbed).

Also, if we ever write a level that demonstrates a bug in Lix, we'll use
image:assets/derived/warning-ladybug.svg[width=16] to self-document it.

=== Who's that guy at the bottom left corner of link:screenshots/README.html#_green_frisbee_special_prior_knowledge[that level with the percentages]?

// Looking for the level?  It's called "The Monty Hall Problem".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem[Monty Hall].

=== Why's there link:screenshots/green-frisbee/special/beware-of/real-world-references/love15.png[a tennis match between Greece and Italy] in there?

// Looking for the level?  It's called "Love Fifteen".

Because I tried to see what national flags I could construct from standard tiles only,
and those two are the result.
They're the first ones I found that comprise
only right angles and only colors available in the standard tiles.

=== What element of the playfield is the goal (exit, place lixes are supposed to get to)?

All the elements on the bottom storey of
link:screenshots/green-frisbee/LEGEND-new-hatches-goals.png[the Legend level]
are goals.

If you can't spot any of these, you might be playing the
link:xdg/share/lix/levels/green-frisbee/unusual/find-the-goal/[`find-the-goal/`] levels,
in which case, see <<bm_how_solve,How does one solve level X?>> hereinabove.

=== Are there any secrets?

Well, for starters, lixes have been taught https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_stroke[the butterfly stroke] ðŸ¤«

Also, several levels have goals (exits) that are easy to miss
(or, in one case, hidden behind terrain).
// This is NOT a reference to the "Exit Stage... Left?" family of levels.


== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): INSTALLATION

=== How do I play these levels? anchor:bm_install[]

==== To test them just once, quickly:

In your shell, run the following command:

 cd /path/to/directory/containing/this/file
 env XDG_DATA_DIRS=${XDG_DATA_DIRS:+"${XDG_DATA_DIRS}:"}"$(pwd)"/xdg/share lix

==== To install them permanently (the Right way):

Add `${ABSOLUTE_PATH_OF_THIS_REPO}/xdg/share` to the value of `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`
in your per-session environment variables.
(The way to do so depends on your shell and desktop environment.)

The change will take effect after you logout and login again.
Until then, you can use the env(1) method above.

==== To install them permanently (the quick-and-dirty way):

Run this:

 mkdir -p ~/.local/share/lix &&
 rsync -a xdg/share/lix/ ~/.local/share/lix

Make sure to include the trailing slash.

After installing, **restart Lix** if it was running.
This seems to be needed in order to refresh the images cache.

==== Background: How Lix finds level packs

To play these levels, `./xdg/share/lix/levels/` and `./xdg/share/lix/images/` need to be available
as `$d/lix/levels/` and `$d/lix/images/`, where `$d` is one of:

1. An element of {xdg-basedir-spec-url}[`$XDG_DATA_DIRS`]
2. `~/.local/share`
3. `/usr/local/share`
4. `/usr/share`

See https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/blob/v0.10.12/src/file/filename/fhs.d#L82-L96
for the gory details.

=== What version of Lix is required?

Hopefully, 0.9.29 or greater would work.

These levels were developed with Lix 0.9.29-1.1+b1 from Debian 11 Bullseye.
Newer versions of Lix do NOT generally get tested as they become available
(surprisingly enough, this thing isn't our $DAYJOB);
nevertheless, pull requests to support newer versions of Lix are welcome.


== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): MISCELLANY

=== How do I contribute?

Open an issue or a pull request.

=== Those messages in English comprised of pipe tiles, how to generate them?

See `scripts/generate-letter-groups-usage.py`.

=== How did you choose the name _Cephalics_?

We grepped a wordlist for words that rhyme with "lix".

Specifically,
we grepped `/usr/share/dict/british-english-huge` for `l(i|ea|ee)(x|[ck].*[scx])`,
and
grepped the results of that for `li[ckx]+s$`.

(I used `:v/â€¦/d` and `:g/â€¦/m$` in Vim; YMMV.)

Then we ruled out those options that were already registered at GitHub
(the hosting site used by Lix itself).
