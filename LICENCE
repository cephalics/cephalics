LEVELS
======

All levels are licensed under CC0 (except uncopyrightable ones, if any).

Most of them are original work; exceptions are:

* lixdatadir/levels/green-frisbee/special/illustrative/formation-drilling.txt
  is a cleanroom reimplementation of a Lemmings™ level.  The key idea
  of the level was also come up with in the level entitled "Decompression Method",
  where it is used to force the player to deal with the walkers individually.

* lixdatadir/levels/green-frisbee/special/beware-of/real-world-references/out-of-africa.txt

Terrain derived from assets/mirrored/molumen-world-map.svg (about which see
elsewhere in this file).

(For the record, the SVG was rasterized at width 3200px, and then the result
mapped to two colours—#000000 and #FF00FF—and used as the background
of out-of-africa.txt.)

Derived works of graphics that ship with Lix itself (data/images/lix.I.png,
images/raymanni/toys/cracker.png, images/raymanni/lab/launcher_right.T.png,
and images/matt/beach/nighttime/03.png), as in version 0.9.29-1.1+b1 of the
lix-data package in Debian 11 Bullseye.  The modifications that are
copyrightable are licensed under CC0.

The light green in the "advent" hatches and the eponymous, uniform-color
variant of "cracker" was chosen by rolling dice.

The teal, violet, green, greyscale, and azure variants of "cracker" were derived
from cracker.png's colours in GIMP.

The colours in "goalling" were derived from lix.I.png's colours using some
combination of "Invert Colours", "Rotate Colours", and "Channel Mixer" in GIMP.

The colours in house2.G.png are taken from lix.I.png verbatim.
